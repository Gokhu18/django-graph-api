Contribution Guidelines
=======================

We use `Github projects`_ to organize our ticket workflow.
If there's `a particular issue`_ you would like to work on and it isn't already assigned, feel free to assign it to yourself and start work!
If you just want to lend a hand, check out the current project and choose one of the tickets from the issues!

Once you're done writing code, you will need to open a pull request with your changes.
In order to be merged, pull requests must fulfill the following requirements:

- All new code must have tests.
- All tests must be passing.
- Any relevant documentation has been updated.

If you need help with something, that's totally fine.
Do what you can and then ask for what you need!
A good place to ask for help is on the issue that you're attempting to tackle; leave a comment with the question that you've got and what you've attempted thus far.
Be aware that there may be a delay before someone comes along who has time to provide assistance.

Once your pull request is complete, one of the core contributors will review it and give feedback or merge as appropriate.

To run the tests, run ``pytest``.

If you have any questions or want to start contributing, chat with us on Slack_.
