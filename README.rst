Django Graph API
================

This is an implementation of GraphQL_ in Python_, designed to work with the
Django_ web framework. The project began at `DjangoCon US 2017`_.

Why Not Graphene?
-----------------

Graphene_ is the standard Python implmentation of GraphQL, and it is far more
mature than Django Graph API. So why should you use this project instead of
Graphene?

* Django Graph API is **Pythonic**, while Graphene was ported over from Node.js
  and follows Javascript idioms.
